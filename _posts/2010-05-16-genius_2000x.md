Let me tell you a story about my Genius 2000X Speakers.  
I am very satisfied with the tone of these speakers. Only one thing which disturbing is a soft hum. I use it with a laptop and when I go to bed the computer is delayed to shutdown but the speakers are on all night. If the shutdown is earlier as I would fall asleep then I hear the hum from the speakers. So I decided to eliminate somehow. I had some failed try but finally succeeded.<!--more-->

- My first try was to apply 100nF bypass capacitors on the four rectifier diodes. Unfortunately the hum level is unchanged. :([![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/05/1st_try-150x150.jpg "1st\_try")]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/05/1st_try.jpg)

- The second try was to change the two 3300uF buffer capacitors to 10000uF. Unfortunately the hum level is still the same. So I put back the two 3300uF :( :(

- I took a look on the amplifier circuit and red on the TDA2050 data sheet that is strongly power supply hum sensitive. So I decided to build a new stabilized power supply on a separated board. The original supply voltage is +-20.4V in idle by my measurements. Than got back to the data sheet of TDA2050 and I realized that +-15V can be sufficient. I tried to use 7815 and 7915 voltage regulators to build a stabilized power supply. My first fault was to not think with the maximum supply current of 7815 and 7915. These are 1A in optimal use. But 2 x 2A is needed for the maximum output power on the amplifier. The sinks were overheated on new board although the amplifier was idle. :( :( :(

- I decided to plan a stronger power supply. I kept 7815 and 7915 but extended with BD241 and BD242 transistors. I used a more effective sink on the new board. The new board gets supply from the transformer directly. &nbsp;The stabilized +-15V is wired to the 3300uF capacitors on the amplifier board. &nbsp;The result is heaven. Speakers in idle are finally as silent as outer space. There is no discoverable distortion or power fall neither higher volume levels :)
