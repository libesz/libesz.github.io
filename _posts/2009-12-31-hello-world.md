excerpt: Welcome to my site!

Welcome to my site. First thing is that sorry for my English. Here I will try to share as many of my projects as I can.

The possible subjects will based on AVR (Atmel's 8bit RISC) microcontrollers, or probably some little Linux programs.

I start this page, because I got almost all of the help to my projects from the internet, from people's blog like this, and now I try to give back a little to this community.

For the AVR projects I usually use WinAVR and AVR Studio, so you can get my projects in C code.
